# CS2550FinalProject

There are three components in our project: a transaction manager, a scheduler, and a data manager.

## Compiling the project

To compile the project, please use the following command line:
      
```
javac -cp ".;jgraph-5.13.0.0.jar;jgraphx-2.0.0.1.jar;jgrapht-core-1.0.1.jar" myPTA.java
```

## Usage

To run the project, we can use three or four arguments. The first argument is used for specifying the script file directory. The second argument is used for specifying the table script directory. The third is used for specifying the buffer size. The fourth argument is optional, used for specifying the seed of transaction randomized selection. The following is an example:

```
java myPTA scripts tables 100
```
